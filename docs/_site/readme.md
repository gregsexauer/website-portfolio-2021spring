This website still needs a lot of work, and I plan on continuing development for the final portion of the class.

For reasons I do not have time to figure out, the website only functions locally. Links are broken when hosted online. 

The website is also pretty sparce. But though it lacks in content, it has quite a bit of neat functionality that will make it much easier to fill the gaps in content. There is a lot of Jekyll backend that handles things like categorizing posts and keeping code clean. All posts are listed on the home page, index. Posts will also appear on author-specific pages, and on tag-specific pages. These posts only need to be written once, in a markdown file, and will display at all relevant locations. Authors' pages and space on the Team page functions in a similar way, being automatically generated from the contents of a single markdown file. 

There is still a good amount of cleanup to do. Most of it is small css tweaks that I already have planned, or that were mentioned from user feedback. I also need to get the website working on the web, which may or may not be difficult.
